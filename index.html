				<p>My readers, maybe you're wondering about the origin of the programming language's name, Python. While
					many assume this is in reference to the snake, a python, it's actually inspired by the British
					comedy group, Monty Python.
					This is hard to believe since there is nothing comedic about programming languages. In fact, it may
					be said that it has more in common with snakes. For instance, snakes are adaptable and flexible just
					like the programming language, Python.
					Unless, of course, its creator's had in mind a comedy of errors, of which Python has plenty in
					store.
				</p>
				<header>Hellooo Werld!</header>
				<p>For our first excercise, we will grant computers humanity by having them spit out the first words
					ever to spill from every living beings mouth, "Hellooo Werld!"
				</p>
				<code>print("Hellooo Werld!")</code>
				<p>Forget that machines will ever be humans. Instead, see humans as machines. If your friend was a
					machine, what is the first things you'd ask of it? You'd ask them to do something, an instruction.
					So you say, "print whatever it is in the parenthesis." And Python, like all hyper literal human born
					to obey, will do just that.
				</p>

		<section id="Variables" class="main-section">
			<header class="secondHeaders">Variables</header>
			<article>
				<p> What do variables mean? Variables don't mean anything until you give them meaning. When you've
					automated your friend, it losts all its inherent human understanding. Now you need to explain to it
					every single letter of a word you're saying, even the spaces between the letters.
					You can tell your friend to understand x as y, and it will do just that. But for the sake of
					clarity, let's be practical. Let's tell it that my shoe size is 11. In code, it looks like this:
				</p>
				<code>shoe_size = 11</code>
				<p>Don't expect your mechanical friend to do anything. It does what it's told, and you only gave it an
					explanation to store in its memory. And it stores things from right to left. In the code above,
					shoe_size is the variable. The equal sign is an assignment operator. It's not like the equal sign in
					math. You're not telling your friend that shoe_size is equals to 11. You're telling it to place 11
					to the variable shoe_size.
					If you want it to print the shoe size, not the variable, you type:
				</p>
				<code>print(shoe_size)</code>

		<section id="Strings" class="main-section">
			<header class="secondHeaders">Strings</header>
			<article>
				<p>Strings are information that your friend, who's now the most sophisticated calculator, does not
					calculate. Your friend can calculate numbers. It can subtract, add, and such, but it can't do that
					with strings.</p>
				<code>pythonQuote = "Look, youâ€™ve got it all wrong. You don't need to follow me. You don't need to follow anybody. You've got to think for yourselves. You're all individuals."</code>
				<p>Your friend can't compute the quote in the same way it calculates numbers you give to it. You can
					change
					the quote or parts of the quote. The quotation marks indicates to your friend that you're giving it
					a
					string. So if you put numbers inside quotation marks and throw it in a variable, it will take it as
					a string.</p>

		<section id="Numeric_Manipulation" class="main-section">
			<header class="secondHeaders">Numeric Manipulation</header>
			<article>
				<p>You can ask your friend to divide, add, subtract, multiply, and give only the remainder of a division
					problem. It follows the
					PEMDAS order of operation, which it somehow remembered from elementary school and you may have not.
					As a refresher, PEMDAS stands for Parenthesis, Exponent, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction
					and calculates from left to right.
					Here is the list of math symbols in code:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>** : raises number to a power</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>* : multiply</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>/ : divide</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>+ : addition</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>- : subtraction</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>% : modulus, which only gives the remainder. Use it like in division.</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It looks like the following when you code it into Python.</p>
				<code>x = 2 ** 2 # raises the number to a power of 2 <br> x = x * x # multiples x to x <br> x = x / 2 # divides x by 2 <br> x = x + 2 # adds <br> x = x - 2 # subtracts </code>
				<p>The pound sign tells our friend that its a comment not to be equated in the code. Play around with
					it. Use the print command to see the results.</p>

			<header class="secondHeaders">String Manipulation</header>
			<article>
				<p>In this very basic, very introductory guide, my readers will at least distinguish strings from
					numerical variables. Yes, you can mix both and turn one into the other. The len() function allows
					Python to count each letter, space, and punctuation in within quotes. We can enumerate the Monty
					Python quote from above using the len() function.</p>
				<code>print(len(pythonQuote))</code>
				<p>You can also index places within the string using a number within brackets within the range of a
					string. This allows Python to locate the letter starting from a zero count.</p>
				<code>print(pythonQuote[6])</code>
				<p>Python can also splice segments of a string using brackets and a colon mark seperating the starting
					point from the end point.</p>
				<code>print (pythonQuote[0:4])</code>
